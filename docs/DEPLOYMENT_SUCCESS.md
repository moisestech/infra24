# ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Success - Badge Component Fix

## **Issue Resolved**
- **Problem**: Badge component case sensitivity causing "Module not found" errors
- **Root Cause**: File tracked as `Badge.tsx` but imports expected `badge.tsx`
- **Solution**: Renamed file to match import case sensitivity requirements

## **Fix Applied**
- Renamed `components/ui/Badge.tsx` â†’ `components/ui/badge.tsx`
- Added build error debugging script
- Committed and deployed successfully

## **Deployment Status**
- **Commit**: `6ff1be9`
- **Status**: âœ… Deployed successfully
- **Build**: âœ… No more module resolution errors

## **Lessons Learned**
1. Production builds (Linux) are case-sensitive
2. Local development (macOS) is case-insensitive
3. Always ensure file names match import statements exactly
4. Use `git mv` to rename files while preserving history
