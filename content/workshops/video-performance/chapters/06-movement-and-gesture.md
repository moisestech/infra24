# Movement and Gesture in Video Performance

Your body is a powerful tool for communication in video performance. Movement and gestures can emphasize your message, convey emotion, and create connection with your audience. In this chapter, we'll explore how to use your body effectively while staying within the frame and maintaining professional quality.

## Understanding Body Language

### The Power of Non-Verbal Communication

**Research shows that**:
- **55% of communication** is body language
- **38% is tone of voice**
- **Only 7% is the actual words**

**In video performance, body language**:
- **Reinforces your message**
- **Conveys authenticity**
- **Creates engagement**
- **Builds trust and connection**

### Types of Body Language

**Open vs. Closed Posture**:
- **Open posture**: Shoulders back, arms uncrossed, facing forward
- **Closed posture**: Crossed arms, turned away, defensive positioning
- **Video application**: Open posture creates approachability and confidence

**Confident vs. Nervous Gestures**:
- **Confident**: Steady movements, purposeful gestures, relaxed stance
- **Nervous**: Fidgeting, repetitive movements, tense positioning
- **Video application**: Practice confident body language to build actual confidence

## Effective Gestures for Video

### Types of Gestures

**Descriptive Gestures**:
- **Illustrate what you're saying**
- **Show size, shape, or direction**
- **Help explain complex concepts**
- **Make content more visual**

**Emphatic Gestures**:

### Gesture Guidelines

- **Test your setup** before recording**

**Safe Movement Zones**:

- **Arms and hands**: Can move freely
- **Full body**: Only if using wide shot

### Natural Movement Patterns

**Conversational Movement**:
