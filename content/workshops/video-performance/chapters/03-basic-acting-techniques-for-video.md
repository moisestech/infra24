# Basic Acting Techniques for Video

While video performance isn't traditional acting, many acting techniques can enhance your ability to connect with audiences and deliver compelling content. In this chapter, we'll explore fundamental acting principles adapted specifically for video performance.

## Acting vs. Video Performance

### Key Differences

**Traditional Acting**:
- Performs for live audiences
- Often portrays fictional characters
- Uses stage or film techniques
- Requires memorization of scripts

**Video Performance**:
- Performs for camera/recording
- Often presents authentic self
- Uses intimate, conversational style
- May use notes or talking points

### Shared Principles

Both acting and video performance require:
- **Emotional authenticity**
- **Clear communication**
- **Engaging presence**
- **Connection with audience**

## The Foundation: Emotional Truth

### What is Emotional Truth?

Emotional truth is the authentic expression of genuine feelings and experiences. In video performance, this means:

- **Being genuine** in your emotional responses
- **Connecting with your own experiences** to inform your performance
- **Allowing vulnerability** while maintaining professionalism
- **Using your emotions** to enhance your message

### The "Magic If"

Stanislavski's "Magic If" technique asks: "What would I do if I were in this situation?"

**For Video Performance**:
- "What would I do if I were explaining this to my best friend?"
- "How would I feel if I were sharing this experience for the first time?"
- "What would my reaction be if I were hearing this news?"

**Practice Exercise**: Choose a topic you want to discuss in a video. Ask yourself the "Magic If" questions to connect with the emotional truth of your content.

## Physical Expression for Video

Your body language communicates as much as your words:

**Open Posture**:
- Shoulders back and relaxed
