## How Search Engines Work

Search engines use complex algorithms to crawl, index, and rank websites. Here's a simplified overview:

1. **Crawling**: Search engine bots visit your website and follow links
2. **Indexing**: Your pages are stored in a massive database
3. **Ranking**: When someone searches, the search engine finds relevant pages and ranks them

## The Three Pillars of SEO

SEO can be broken down into three main areas:

### 1. Technical SEO
This involves the technical aspects of your website that affect how search engines crawl and index your content.

### 2. On-Page SEO
This focuses on optimizing the content and HTML elements of your individual pages.

### 3. Off-Page SEO
This involves activities outside your website that influence your rankings, primarily link building.

## Organic vs. Paid Search Results

It's important to understand the difference between organic and paid search results:

- **Organic Results**: These appear naturally based on SEO efforts (free, but takes time)
- **Paid Results**: These appear because you pay for them (immediate, but costs money)
